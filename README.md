# CoronovirusPrediction

I used Anaconda environment to run the project and used python and flask for backend and used HTML for webpage . 
This project mainly focuses on predicting corona virus .
The algorithms used in this ML model are Naive Bayes Algorithm , RandomForestClassifier , LogisticRegression . 

How to use this model/ execute this model :

1. First wee need to install all the software requiremnts specified above .
2. Need to preprocess the dataset and remove the missing values .
3. Need to run the covid prediction model which is a jupyter notebook file . That can train the model .
4. AFter training the model , we should run the python flask web application .
5. We can give the input through choosing yes/no through the input page and the model will predict if we are affected by corono virus or not .
6. Then the result page will show the output of the prediction model .


This is final year project done by ,
